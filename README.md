<h1> Person Counter App </h1>
    <h3>Welcome to a very small project, <br> you could almost call it an assignment. </h3>
    
<p> I've been going through a JS course, you create this while learning. <br> So I thought i'd just share it, even though it's very small. </p>
<p> Ever wanted to keep track of how many people actually enter your bus/train/street etc ? <br> Now you can! Just click away on the increment button and save your amount. <br> Forgotton how many it were previously? No worries! Your saves are written below. </p>
